# TextParser
 
## What can this parser do?

For now there is only two features work:
- Get size of text inside the file
- Get count of every word in searching file

## How to

Run application in your command prompt using one these arguments:

`-h` or `--help`               shows help message and exits.<br>
`-v` or `--version`            prints version information and exits.<br>
`-p` or `--FullFilePath`       specify the path to file you going to read from. [required]

So, if you use -p argument, the program will show you parse results.
